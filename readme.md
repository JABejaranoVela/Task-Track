Taskly: CLI TODO App

📖 Description
Taskly is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) application for efficient task management.
Built as the final project for CS50P, it allows you to add, update, delete, list, and track tasks directly from your terminal.

✨ Features
Add a Task → Create tasks with descriptions. Each task gets a unique ID and a default todo status.
Update a Task → Modify the description or status of a task.
Mark as In-Progress → Quickly change a task’s status to in-progress.
Mark as Done → Quickly change a task’s status to done.
Delete a Task → Remove tasks by their ID.
List Tasks → Display all tasks or filter them by:
status: todo, in-progress, done, or all
date: filter by creation date with operators <, >, =
